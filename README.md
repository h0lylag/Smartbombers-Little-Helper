Smartbomber's Little Helper

Monitors ~/Documents/EVE/logs/Gamelogs for updates and watches for lines where damage is applied to dreadnoughts or titans. When a dread spawns while smartbomb ratting, you will naturally produce logs that you are applying damage. When this is detected, the application sends an alert to the user.
